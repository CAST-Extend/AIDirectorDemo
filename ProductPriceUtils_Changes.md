# Changes to ProductPriceUtils.java

1. **Made `getStoreFormatedAmountWithCurrency` Method Static**
   - The method `getStoreFormatedAmountWithCurrency(MerchantStore store, BigDecimal amount)` was modified to be a static method to align with the task requirements.

   - Ensure all dependent code is updated to use the static method.

3. **Replaced Deprecated Method Calls in BeanStreamPayment.java**

   - Ensured that the new static method is used correctly in the context of the file.
