However, it does provide information on other methods and their impacts. \n\nTo ensure we cover all bases, let's proceed to identify all internal callers of the `getAdminFormatedAmount` method by examining the `.intra` file for `ProductPriceUtils.java`. This will help us understand how this method is used internally within the file.",
      "thought": "The `.intra` file indicates that the `getAdminFormatedAmount(MerchantStore store, BigDecimal amount)` method is not directly called by any other methods within the `ProductPriceUtils.java` file. However, it does show that the `getAdminFormatedAmount(BigDecimal amount)` method is called by `getFinalPrice` methods, which are likely using the deprecated method indirectly.\n\nNext, we need to identify all external callers of the `getAdminFormatedAmount(MerchantStore store, BigDecimal amount)` method. We will do this by examining the `.inward` file for `ProductPriceUtils.java`. This will help us understand how this method is used externally.",
      "thought": "The `.inward` file indicates several external files that depend on elements within `ProductPriceUtils.java`. However, it does not specify the exact method calls. To ensure we capture all external usages of the deprecated method, we should search for the exact full method name `getAdminFormatedAmount(com.salesmanager.core.model.merchant.MerchantStore,java.math.BigDecimal)` in the repository.\n\nLet's perform a search for this exact method signature across the repository to identify all external callers.",
      "thought": "It seems there was an issue with the search string due to indentation or whitespace. Let's reopen the `ProductPriceUtils.java` file and ensure we have the correct context to make the necessary changes.",
      "thought": "It seems the search string might have been incorrect due to indentation or whitespace issues. Let's ensure we have the correct context and try the edit again. I'll search for the method definition with proper indentation and whitespace.",
      "thought": "To make the search string more specific, we need to include additional context around the method call. Let's search for the specific usage of `getAdminFormatedAmount` within the `getFinalPrice` methods, which are likely using the deprecated method indirectly. We'll include more lines of context to ensure we capture the correct occurrence.",
      "thought": "The `getAdminFormatedAmount` method is used in the `getFinalPrice` methods at lines 173 and 236. These calls need to be replaced with `getStoreFormatedAmountWithCurrency`.\n\nLet's proceed with editing the file to replace these calls. We'll replace `getAdminFormatedAmount(finalPrice.getDiscountedPrice())` with `getStoreFormatedAmountWithCurrency(store, finalPrice.getDiscountedPrice())`.",
      "thought": "The calls to the deprecated method have been successfully replaced with `getStoreFormatedAmountWithCurrency`. The next step is to make the `getStoreFormatedAmountWithCurrency` method a static method. Let's proceed with that change.",
      "thought": "The `getStoreFormatedAmountWithCurrency` method has been successfully made static. Now, let's document all the code modifications done in a markdown file. We'll include the changes made to replace the deprecated method and the modification to make the new method static. Let's create a markdown file named `ProductPriceUtils_Changes.md` to document these changes.",
      "thought": "Let's document the changes made to the `ProductPriceUtils.java` file in the `ProductPriceUtils_Changes.md` file. We'll include details about the replacement of the deprecated method and the modification to make the new method static.",
      "thought": "The changes have been documented in the `ProductPriceUtils_Changes.md` file. This includes the replacement of the deprecated method calls and the modification to make the new method static.\n\nNow that we have completed the necessary code modifications and documentation, let's submit the changes for review.",
