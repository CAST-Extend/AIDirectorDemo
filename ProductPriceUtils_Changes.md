# ProductPriceUtils Changes

## Modifications

1. **Deprecated Method Removal**
   - Removed usage of the deprecated method `getAdminFormatedAmount(MerchantStore store, BigDecimal amount)`.

2. **Static Method Update**
   - Updated the method `getStoreFormatedAmountWithCurrency(MerchantStore store, BigDecimal amount)` to be a static method.

These changes were made to address technical debt by removing deprecated methods and improving code maintainability.
